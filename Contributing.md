# Contributing

This page isn't fleshed out yet, sorry! Feel free to send PRs to make it better.

In order to build the website you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Git.

Then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ReactJSGirls/reactjsgirls-docs.git
cd reactjsgirls-docs
npm install
```

You can then start the development server by running:

```sh
npm run dev
# yarn dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

When done please add your self to the all contributors. To do this run:

```sh
 npm run contributors:add
```

Then when asked placed your username and your comtribs and run:

```sh
 npm run generate
```

Thank you for making the react community better
